On Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday this can be on any agreed time.;We have several tramlines withing walking distance (7/12/13/14/17), connecting you with the various parts of the city and of course the city centre. Nightbus 352 or 353 will get you home again when the trams stop going. The trams also take you to various trainstations (Lelylaan, Sloterdijk, Central Station) and from there to the airport. Also, the Park + Ride facilities are easily reachable with trams 7 (Bos en Lommer) or 12 (Sloterdijk). We have two extra bikes that we rent out for 7 euro per bike per day. They are your typical Amsterdam city bikes, nothing fancy, but in perfect condition and well maintained. Just let us know if you're interested. If these bikes don't suit you, or if you want to decide on the spot to rent a bike, there are a lot of bike rental shops all over town, also in our neighbourhood.;You are welcome to our living room as well, to watch tv or just hang out.

Do as the Dutch do and go ride your"";none;I love that this neighborhood is close to the center yet just outside of it so you can find the localness and regularness of a typical Amsterdam neighborhood", with its  Amsterdammers filled local shops, restaurants and cafe's. So the local Amsterdam experience is right outside the door but if you want to experience the old center of Amsterdam with all of its tourist attractions then you walk for lass than 1 minute, hop in a tram or bus and a few minutes later you're at the heart of the city: the dam square. Or another tram takes you to the museum square when you're ready to see the astonishing works of Van Gogh or the extensive collection of the Rijksmuseum. Prefer to walk around in the scenic Jordaan neighborhood? Then don't even bother taking a tram or bus, just have a nice stroll eastwards and before you know it you're walking along the small picturesque canals of the Jordaan.;;very convenient public transport, busses and trams just a minute walk away from the apartment.;guests will have access to everything;as much interaction with guests as the guests wish, If they want to hang out, i can hang out, if they rather spend time by themselves, then i'll leave them to it :);The most important rules is: Do not bother or disturb the neighors whatsoever. This means whenever you're near the apartment or going upstairs or downstairs, avoid making any noise and whisper untill you're inside the apartment. I've received some complaints in the past and i will not let this happen again. So: be well behaved, don't make loud noise inside of the building and apartment, keep the sound to a minimum, keep the place tidy, so clean after yourself.  NO fire inside of the house (smoking is okay as long as you keep the windows open for fresh air, don't smoke in bed though!).  If you use the heater, turn it off when you leave the apartment! This is very important to assure safety. Same as with the lights, turn them off when you leave the apartment.  Be careful but despite of that If something breaks somehow or there's any other issue, just let me know right away so i can help out.  So we should also be able to keep good communication, we should always be able to call or messag;;;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/c143c5bb684d7379b536c8a8f4a7bbe6;;5113662;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5113662;Stefan;2013-02-17;Amsterdam, North Holland," The Netherlands;""I'm an adventurous energetic guy.
